              I help companies make strategic foundational decisions and
              leverage their position in the market — providing long-term
              support, often through a blend of cash and equity.
            </p>
            <p>
              In recent years, I've helped build multiple businesses leading to
              over $55M in capital investment.

              Culturally, I fit high-energy and fun management teams.
              <br />
              I compete in Hyrox races around the world, care deeply about being
              a present father and husband, and maintain a healthy balance
              between work, life and play.
